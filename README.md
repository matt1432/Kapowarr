# Kapowarr

> [!NOTE]
> This fork was made to add download support from Libgen+.
>
> - Because I am a NixOS user, I decided to make this a hard fork to keep the
    project more in line with what is expected from a python program while putting
    aside backwards compatibility.
> - I've also formatted the code to my preferences to facilitate further development.
> - I will still do my best to keep up to date with upstream, but if you start using
    this fork, you cannot go back to upstream since I've changed some things in the
    database.

  Mega and many other services
